# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Language and Documentation
- All code, comments, and documentation must be written in English.
- All file names, column names (e.g., in manifest.csv), and other labels must be in English.

## Code Quality Standards
- Python code must strictly follow PEP8 standards.
- All functions must have a clear docstring explaining their purpose, arguments (args), and what they return (returns).
- Use descriptive and clear variable names.
- Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

## Git Commit Standards
- Git commits should follow a conventional format (e.g., 'feat: add initial data cleaning').
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why.

## Project Structure
- Follow the established folder structure: /data, /img, /notebooks, /panel, /example.
- Keep data files in the /data folder.
- Store visualizations and charts in the /img folder.
- Place Jupyter notebooks in the /notebooks folder.
- Keep dashboard scripts in the /panel folder.

## Data Analysis Best Practices
- Always validate data quality before analysis.
- Document assumptions and decisions made during data cleaning.
- Use reproducible methods and set random seeds where appropriate.
- Create clear visualizations with proper labels and titles.
- Save intermediate results and cleaned datasets for reproducibility.
